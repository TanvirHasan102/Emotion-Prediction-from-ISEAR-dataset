# Emotion-Prediction-from-ISEAR-dataset

Artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating more and more aspects of our
daily lives, with a rising emphasis on understanding the language that
expresses human emotions. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is important
in this endeavour. Our study utilizes NLP methods to analyze
emotions using the International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions
(ISEAR) dataset, encompassing basic emotions across 37 nations.
Our findings reveal that specific words are associated with each emotion,
giving insights into how people express their feelings. Sentiment analysis
shows that most of the situations expressed by participants were negative,
whereas positive was the lowest. Our study also presents different
machine learning modelsâ€™ performance on the dataset and how feature
selection affects emotion prediction, emphasizing its significant influence
on model performance regarding the accuracy, precision, recall and F1
score metrics. This study adds to our understanding of how people express
emotions through text and predict them accurately. Moreover, this
study will assist future technology designers in creating emotion-aware
technologies.
